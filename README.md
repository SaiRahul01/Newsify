This is a React App to fetch and display News on your Browser, It fetches latest News based on 4 main categories: General, Business, Entertainment, Science and Sports.The API used is [NewsApi](https://newsapi.org/) , and ofcourse the news was limited. This App Would run on local host(3000), did not get deployed as the API would't allow to fetch news if deployed.


Requirements to see the Web App working:
1. Node.js 
2. A Free account on [NewsApi](https://newsapi.org/)

Steps to run:
 
1. Download and Unzip the project folder , open it in any editor
2. Get your API key from NewsApi and paste it in the 13th line of the file App.js inside the ' ' 
3. In the terminal (in the directory of the project) execute : `npm start`
4. It redirects automatically to local host 3000 on your default browser, if not do it manually

Thank You :)
